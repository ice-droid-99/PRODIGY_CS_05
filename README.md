I created a Packet Sniffing tool using Python . Used Scapy Library. It captures and analyzes Network Packets. Display source and destination IP , Protocols and Payload data. This tool should be used for educational purposes only. Furthermore, the gathered data is added to a log file titled packet_log.txt.
